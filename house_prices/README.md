# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

This exercises is about solving [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Do you know kaggle? If you do not, please go on and check it out! There are a lot of competitions and resources!

Straight to the point, below it has the description of the problem as the competitions' page says:

> Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

As you noticed, all resources (including the dataset) can be downloaded from there. Since kaggle has resources and documents from other users who already have done such competition, feel free to use them as your sources! Beyond that, use any resources you cand find! Make yourself at home! However, don't forget to cite the references in your work, please?

## First phase
Is this problem supposed to be a Regression problem, right? Then to get it started, we expect you can predict the home price using Univariate and Multivariate Linear Regression. 

But it has some constraints, ok? We hope you can build the algorithm by yourself. So, you have obey the following points:

- Scikit-learn library can not be used;
- The algorithms and mathematical operations must be implemented with your own functions;
- You can use any other libraries to handle the data (As advice, you may use Pandas and Numpy);
- Here, we do not expect any graphs or analysis, just the algorithms and their results;
- When developing Multivariate Linear Regression, use all variables!
- And when developing Univariate Linear Regression, this is your choice! ;)

Although it is a machine learning challenge, we hope you can show us your software engineer skills, ok? Then, try to organize and make your code readable and beatiful as you can. Surprise us!

## Second phase
Alright, you have developed such algorithms and now we all know how to get home's prices. However, has it good answers? Could you explain us what your feelings about algorithms' results? It could be better, not only your feelings, you might show us why we can belive in your regressor, right?

Some points you have to notice:

 - Which variable you chose when you developed the Univariate Linear Regressor?
 - Is it worth to use all variables when applying them into a Multivariate Linear Regressor? Why?
 - How could we evaluate our algorithms?
 - Describe to us the procedures that you followed.
 - Which evaluators have you chosen? And why? Explain us!
 - Maybe you want to compare your models against scikit-learn models.

I almost forgot it! You can use any ML lib from here and the remainder phases, ok?


## Third Phase
That's good! Now we are getting a better regressor. Don't you agree?
But now, I guess your model has the [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) problem. Alright, how can we solve this problem? Show us alternatives that we can use to avoid this when estimating your models. Even better, you can explain us your understanding (with your own words, of course ;]) about those methods, right?

## Fourth phase
Of course there are many more algorithms to solve regression problems. Since Linear regression was the first we ask you to use, we would like to know which other algorithms you would suggest us to use in this problem. Find out over the literature which algorithms you may apply. In a high level, could you explain us a bit how it works? Cool!


## Fifth phase
You are becoming a great Data Scientist!
**Now, this is your time! Show us your whole creativity!**

Use graphs and any other resources that comes in your mind. Feelings about the dataset can be really interesting! Go on! Let's work hard!
